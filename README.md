# Trajectory_Planning_And_Optimization
Implementation of iLQR for a 2D quadrotor system, direct collocation methods for trajectory planning, and trajectory optimization for a planar arm system with a rigidly attached ball.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several Python files, each addressing a specific aspect of the problem set:

- `iLQR.py`: Contains the implementation of the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) algorithm.
- `find_throwing_trajectory.py`: Implements the direct collocation method for optimizing the trajectory of a planar arm system.
- `kinematic_constraints.py`: Contains the constraints related to the kinematics of the system.
- `dynamics_constraints.py`: Implements the dynamics constraints for the robotic system.
